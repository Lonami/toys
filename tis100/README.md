# tis100

[TIS-100 - Tessellated Intelligence System][1], a game by
[Zachtronics][2] is a really fun game [available on Steam][3].

This repository contains my solutions, which are **obviously
spoilers** if you haven't solved them on your own yet. Use at
your own risk!

Eventually, I would like to have a emulator for it here too.

## Save-path location

The [TIS-100 Hacker's Guide, Save File Format][4] contains common
save file locations, as well as a small description on the format:

* Windows: %userprofile%\Documents\My Games\TIS-100\(USERID)\save
* Linux: $(HOME)/.local/share/TIS-100/$(USERID)/save

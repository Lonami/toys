# Rusty Machine-Learning Stuff

Random things I've found about machine learning that I've decided to implement in Rust.

## backpropers

My implementation of backpropagation with neural networks in Rust.

The original work is by Jason Brownlee, How to Code a Neural Network with Backpropagation
In Python (from scratch), Machine Learning Mastery, available from
https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/,
accessed December 14th, 2020.

However, the code has been heavily adapted to fit Rust patterns better, along with some
additional abstractions to make it nicer.

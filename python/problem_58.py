    It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal,
    but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals
    are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

    If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side
    length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the
    square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?'''

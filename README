My Attempts at https://ProjectEuler.net problems.

The first attempts were in C# and date back to 24th  of January
2016, the first of which I didn't save, the eighth problem does
not work  (apparently?), some solutions are far from efficient,
and I didn't get too far either.

Some remarks:

1. It seems like at first I didn't care much about saving my
   progress, or the problems were too easy.  Problems 1 to 6
   are missing, and 7 to 10 were screenshots before porting.

2. The first function for primality testing was horribly in-
   efficient.  It didn't check just until the square root or
   the number, and constantly re-checked even numbers, being
   running in a time of N instead of sqrt(N) / 2.

3. I wasn't very aware of short-circuiting.  Most resolutions
   run forever and don't early terminate. Some have expensive
   checks first, and the cheap ones later.

The second attempt, this time with Python, was the 12th of July
2016, and over a week reached problem 67. The code style wasn't
fully developed yet, but improved.

Reading  https://boyter.org/posts/reading-files-quickly-in-rust/
and seeing how it mentioned Project Euler made me want to tackle
the problems once again, as of 3th of September of 2018.  I love
the way  Rust  looks and I have tried learning it several times,
however the lack of serious  projects make me easily abandon it.

Now that I know and use git daily,  posting new solutions should
happen as I solve them  instead just bulk adding all the files I
had so far.

Only a resources/ folder is included in the top-level directory.
You are supposed to copy or symlink this folder from the working
directory of the code (Python and Rust), since it's .gitignored.
